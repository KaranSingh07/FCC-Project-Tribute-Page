                    Atal Bihari Vajpayee born in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. Vajpayee had a brilliant
                    career both at school and in the university with scholarships won on merit. He was a fluent speaker
                    in English, inheriting the gift of the gab from his father Pandit K. B. Vajpayee. Father and son
                    created history in the Lucknow University where they studied Law together.

                    During the 1942 Quit India movement, he gave up his studies to court imprisonment and later came
                    back to win another scholarship to pursue his post-graduate studies. He had his political training
                    under the late Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukerji. He was Dr. Mukerji's private secretary, and was with him
                    when he died in a Kashmir jail. Before entering Parliament, Mr. Vajpayee was a journalist by
                    profession and edited Rashtra Dharma and Veer Arjun.

                    As his parliamentary career flourished, Vajpayee made a name for himself as an orator and for his
                    poetic flourishes. Vajpayee, as a member of the Jan Sangh, paid a glowing tribute to Jawaharlal
                    Nehru, in the Rajya Sabha. He described Mr. Nehru as a thoroughly honest man and an idealist “who
                    was never afraid to negotiate and never negotiated with fear”. Though he differed in his views from
                    Mr. Nehru, he burst into tears both in the Upper House and in the all-parties meeting in the Central
                    Hall while paying homage to Mr. Nehru in poetic and chaste Hindi.

                    According to The Hindu, Vajpayee was a firm believer in secularism. He was fond of repeating that
                    "Hinduism was not a religion but a secular way of life," a report published in The Hindu on June 13,
                    1964 read.

                    Vajpayee was Prime Minister with the NDA government after a United Front government fell when the
                    Congress withdrew support. He oversaw the Pokhran nuclear test and the subsequent international
                    sanctions that went with it. The term was also marked by his initiatives for peace with Pakistan and
                    the Lahore declaration. His 13-month government, however, could not withstand the rather fragile
                    coalition that he had put together, and with the AIADMK withdrawing support, his government fell.
